# What is Terraform??
Terraform is an open-source  **Infrastructure As Code** software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

**What is Infrastructure As Code?** <br>
Infrastructure As Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. In simple words we just have to write codes to build our infrastructure.

Terraform has four major commands:

$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
$ terraform destroy
