# What is Terraform??
Terraform is an open-source  **Infrastructure As Code** software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

**What is Infrastructure As Code?** <br>
Infrastructure As Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. In simple words we just have to write codes to build our infrastructure. Whole infrastructure is constructed using code and that 
code is written in terraform. Terrafrom uses JSON as a language. Terraform  has become more popular because it has a simple syntax that allows easy modularity and works against multi-cloud. Terraform is compatible with every Cloud Service Provider **AWS,GCP,AZURE and many more**. You just have to write the code once and then you can use that code with
any of the service provider. <br>

Apart from Cloud, we can use Terrafrom to launch containers for example **Docker**. <br> <br>

# Terraform has four major commands:

**•$ terraform init <br>
•$ terraform plan <br>
•$ terraform apply <br>
•$ terraform destroy**
